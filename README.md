This git contains codes I've written during my Internship at Ingeliance Technologies. 

The intership focused on solving MINLP (Mixed-Integer Non Linear Programming). In this git you will find Python codes implementing some Mono-objectif / Multi-objective algorithm, and some examples using some Python modules. 
There are also tests on the software salome meca to implement a complete calculation chain.
